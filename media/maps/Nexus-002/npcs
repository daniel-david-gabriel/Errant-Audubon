Necromancer Bertram	13	10	necromancer	necromancer	value=1	Coming here out of order?!	value=2	I am surprised to see you so soon...	This part of Lelab-Hor's realm is known as the "Bone Feast" for the bones strewn across these giant stone tables...	As always, I have prepared an exit for you nearby...	But perhaps you'd like to stay for a snack...	Ia Lelab-Hor!
